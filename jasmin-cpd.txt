Reflection
 
In the session today, we were introduced to Git/GitHub. We were shown a quick demo on the advantages of using VS Code. We installed an extension onto VS Code. We have done an introductory demo of how to committ changes in files to a repo that we cloned onto our machines.

I am still getting my head around how GitHub browser, GitHub desktop and VS Code work together.

Reflection
 
I feel like I am getting the hang of how GitHub browser, GitHub desktop and VS Code work together.
I worked out that my site wasn't showing in the browser as I didn't have 'main' selected for the root.
