    <p>This is a summary of what I've learned in my classes.</p>

    <h2>1.3 - 13/10/2020</h2>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>In the session today, we were introduced to Git/GitHub. We were shown a quick demo on the advantages of using VS Code. We installed an extension onto VS Code. We have done an introductory demo of how to committ changes in files to a repo that we cloned onto our machines. I am still getting my head around how GitHub browser, GitHub desktop and VS Code work together.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I feel like I am getting the hang of how GitHub browser, GitHub desktop and VS Code work together. I worked out that my site wasn't showing in the browser as I didn't have 'main' selected for the root.</p>
