    <h1>Jasmin CPD</h1>
    <p class="summary">This is a summary of what I've learned in my classes.</p>

    <h2>Module 1 - HTML</h2>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>We have been introduced to Git/GitHub. We have been shown a quick demo on the advantages of using VS Code. We installed an extension onto VS Code. We have done an introductory demo of how to committ changes in files to a repo that we cloned onto our machines. I am still getting my head around how GitHub browser, GitHub desktop and VS Code work together.</p>
    <p>I feel like I am getting the hang of how GitHub browser, GitHub desktop and VS Code work together. I worked out that my site wasn't showing in the browser as I didn't have 'main' selected for the root.</p>
    <p>I feel that I understand HTML and will work on putting the use of different elements into play.</p>
    <p>I've taken the HTML quiz and did not do very well. I will study some more and then take it again. Here are my results:</p>

    <h2>Module 2 - CSS</h2>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>We have been shown how to set the 'color' for multiple elements. We have been shown have to use a 'div' to set seperated sections of a page simply for visual purposes.</p>
    <p>I am still working on trying to understand Flex and Flex Box as well as other layout options such as floats (and clears).</p>
    <p>I have been studying and coming back to the Google page task but I have not cracked it yet!<p>
    <p>I'd like to use the below 'color' scheme for this CPD page, but need to understand how to style things in a better way before I can introduce more 'color'</p>

    <h2>Module 3 - JavaScript</h2>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>We have created: function, if, return, else, else if and switch. The 3.3.3 task was for creating a calculator with multiple operator options went well and here are my console.log results:</p>

        <figcaption>You can view my JavaScript code <a href="module-3/task-3.3.3.html">here.</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>We have created a Shopping Cart array of objects and used a function, with variables, if and else statements, to return the totalPrice for a shopping basket.</p>
    <p>We have created a filter where you can filter out images by using the 'forEach', the 'addEventListener' and 'click'.
